# Contributing

## Workflow

This cookbook uses a pretty standard GitHub workflow:

 * Fork it
 * [Run the tests](./TESTING.md)
 * Create a branch, make your changes
 * Run the tests again
 * Push your branch
 * Submit a pull request
 * Be patient

## Documentation Updates

All new attributes introduced must be added to the README file. If any attributes are removed
or their behavior changes, please strees it in the pull request message.


## Pull Requests that Slip Under the Radar

If you get no response of any kind of **several days**, feel free to mention one of the
maintainers in a pull request comment:

 * @michaelklishin
 * @vkhatri

Please be respectful to the maintainers and do not abuse the above method. They do receive notifications
about issues and pull requests. Unjustified additional mentions will not be appreciated.
